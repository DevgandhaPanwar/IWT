                <h2> A little more about me..:)</h2>
                <p>
                    I’ve always loved spending way too much time on the computer, and spent my teens tinkering with Photoshop and building crappy websites.<br><br>

                    But after getting a computer science degree, I realized writing compilers wasn’t for me and decided to switch majors completely and learn Mandarin instead.<br><br>

                    Yet as it turns out, my path would lead back to computers: after moving to China in 2006, I ended up quitting my language studies and getting a job in Beijing as a web designer.

                <p>
                    After coming back to France in 2007, I became a freelance UI designer, working with companies such as Hipmunk, Intercom, and Le Monde.<br>

                    <br>A few years later, I decided what I really wanted was to create my own products, and set out to re-learn web programming.<br><br>

                    After moving to Japan in 2012 for my wife’s studies, I now live in Kyoto and work on running developer surveys.
